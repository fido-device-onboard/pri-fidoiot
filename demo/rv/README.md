# System Requirements:

* **Ubuntu 20.04**.
* **Maven**.
* **Java 11**.
* **Haveged**.

# Getting the executable

Use the following commands to build FIDO IoT RV Component sample source.
```
$ cd <fido-iot-src>/service/component-samples/rv/
$ mvn clean install
```

This will copy the required executables and libraries into <fido-iot-src>/demo/rv/.

# Configuring the FIDO IoT RV Sample

Some required runtime arguments

- `rv_port`

  RV server port.

  Default value: 8040

- `rv_database_connection_url`

   JDBC URL for connection to database. Includes the database driver name, port number for database and the location of `.db` file

  Default value: jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost:8050/./target/data/rvs

- `rv_database_username`

  RV database username.

  Default value: sa

- `rv_database_password`

  RV database password.

  Default value: <no-password>

- `rv_database_port`

  RV database port number.

  Default value: 8050

- `epid_online_url`

  EPID Verification Service URL for EPID device signature verification.

  Default value: https://verify.epid-sbx.trustedservices.intel.com/
  Other server options: https://verify.epid.trustedservices.intel.com/ (production EPID verification server), https://localhost:1180 (onprem verification service)

- `epid_test_mode`

   EPID devices can be tested using `Test` mode, it is intended for supporting onboarding for `development` and `test` devices. Enabling the test mode means signature verification won't be performed for the device.

   Default value: false

   **NOTE** Not recommended for use in production systems.

- `catalina_home`

  Tomcat configuration for catalina home.

  Default value: ./target/tomcat

# Enabling Remote Access to DB

Remote access to H2 Sample Storage DB has been disabled by default. Enabling the access creates a security hole in the system which makes it vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.

To enable remote access to DB update the `db.tcpServer` and `webAllowOthers` properties in `<fido-iot-src>/service/component-samples/rv/src/main/java/org/fido/iot/sample/RvServerApp.java` file

```
db.tcpServer = -tcp -tcpAllowOthers -ifNotExists -tcpPort <rv_db_port>
webAllowOthers = true
```

**IMPORTANT: Not recommended to enable this setting especially on production systems.**

# Starting the rv service

Refer the [Docker Commands](../README.md/#docker-commands) to start the service.

# Allowlist and Denylist Configuration

- RV provides the option to allow and deny requests based on the owner, manufacturer and reseller public keys and based on the GUID used in the Device Ownership Voucher
header.
- To add entries to these allowlist and denylist, update the `config.properties` file in `<fido-iot-src>/storage/storage-samples/storage-rv-sample/src/main/resources` location and rebuild the code and restart the docker or update the `config.properties` in `demo/rv` and restart the docker.
- Once updated, rebuild the code, rebuild RV docker image and then start the docker.
- The hashes for the default public keys present of owner, manufacturer and reseller are already added in allowlist configuration of component sample. The table below lists them.

- To add entries to allowlist and denylist for public key, public key hash need to be calculated. Refer [Generating Public Key Hash](#calculate-sha256-hash-of-a-public-key) for the steps to generate public key hash from public key.

**IMPORTANT** This is an example implementation using simplified credentials. This must be changed while performing production deployment

# Calculate SHA256 hash of a public key

```
$ openssl x509 -in cert.pem -pubkey -noout | openssl enc -base64 -d > example_allowlist_publickey.der

$ cat example_allowlist_publickey.der | openssl dgst -sha256 | awk '/s/{print toupper($2)}'
```

***NOTE:*** Input file cert.pem is an X509 certificate.
