# System Requirements:

* **Ubuntu 20.04**.
* **Maven**.
* **Java 11**.
* **Haveged**.
* **SoftHSM**.

# Getting the executable

Use the following commands to build FIDO IoT Reseller Component sample source.
```
$ cd <fido-iot-src>/service/component-samples/reseller/
$ mvn clean install
```

This will copy the required executables and libraries into \<fido-iot-src\>/demo/reseller/.

# Configuring the FIDO IoT Reseller Sample

# Enabling Remote Access to DB

Remote access to H2 Sample Storage DB has been disabled by default. Enabling the access creates a security hole in the system which makes it vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.

To enable remote access to DB update the `db.tcpServer` and `webAllowOthers` properties in `<fido-iot-src>/service/component-samples/reseller/src/main/java/org/fido/iot/sample/ResellerServerApp.java` file

```
db.tcpServer = -tcp -tcpAllowOthers -ifNotExists -tcpPort <reseller_db_port>
webAllowOthers = true
```

**IMPORTANT: Not recommended to enable this setting especially on production systems.**

# Starting the Reseller service

Refer the [Docker Commands](../README.md/#docker-commands) to start the service.

***NOTE*** The database file located at \<fido-iot-src\>/demo/reseller/target/data/reseller.mv.db is not deleted during 'mvn clean'. As a result, the database schema and tables are persisted across docker invocations. Please delete the file manually, if you encounter any error due to persisted stale data.

# FIDO IoT Reseller REST APIs

| Operation                      | Description                        | Path/Query Parameters    | Content Type   |Request Body  | Response Body |
| ------------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|:------------------------:|:--------------:|-------------:|--------------:|
| GET /api/v1/resell/vouchers/<serial_number>?id=<customer_id> | Assigns the customer and returns the extended voucher for the given serial number from `RT_DEVICES` table. | Query - id: Customer Id, Path - Device Serial Number | | | Ownership voucher |
| POST /api/v1/resell/vouchers/<serial_number> | Adds voucher to `RT_DEVICES` table against the serial number. | Path - Device Serial Number | application/cbor | Ownership voucher | |
| DELETE /api/v1/resell/vouchers/<serial_number> | Deletes voucher from `RT_DEVICES` table with the specified serial number. | Path - Device Serial Number | | | |
| POST /api/v1/resell/customers/?id=<customer_id>&name=<customer_name> | Adds customer keyset to `RT_CUSTOMERS` table. | Query - id: Customer Id, name: Customer Name | text/plain; charset=us-ascii | Customer PEM formatted Public keys | |
| DELETE /api/v1/resell/customers/<customer_id> | Deletes customer keyset from `RT_CUSTOMERS` table. | Path - Customer Id | | | |
| POST /api/v1/resell/keys/?alias=<keystore_alias> | Adds new Reseller keys to the keystore with the given alias | Query - alias: Alias to be added in keystore | | PEM formatted certificate and private key | |
| DELETE /api/v1/resell/keys/?alias=<keystore_alias> | Deletes the keys corresponding to the input alias from keystore. | Query - alias: Alias to be removed from keystore | | | |

***NOTE*** These REST APIs use Digest authentication. `reseller_api_user` and `reseller_api_password` properties specify the credentials to be used while making the REST calls.

# Inserting keys into Reseller keystore

The PKCS12 keystore file \<fido-iot-src\>/demo/reseller/reseller_keystore.p12 contains the default reseller keys that are imported into the softHSM keystore inside the container, during startup. It contains 3 PrivateKeyEntry with algorithm types: EC-256, EC-384 and RSA-2048, and should continue to hold PrivateKeyEntry with different algorithms. To insert/replace an existing PrivateKeyEntry of any particular algorithm, refer to section [Inserting Keys into Keystore](../README.md/#inserting-keys-into-keystore) to insert new certificate/private-key pair into \<fido-iot-src\>/demo/reseller/reseller_keystore.p12.

**IMPORTANT** This is an example implementation using simplified credentials. This must be changed while performing production deployment
