# Getting the Executable

Use the following commands to build FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) Protocol Reference Implementation (PRI) HTTP Device Component sample source.
For the instructions in this document, `<fdo-pri-src>` refers to the path of the FDO PRI folder 'pri-fidoiot'.
```
$ cd <fdo-pri-src>/component-samples/device/
$ mvn clean install
```

This will copy the required executables and libraries into <fdo-pri-src>/component-samples/demo/device/.

### Configuring the Device Service

All the runtime configurations for the device is specified in `service.yml` file.

`service.yml` file is structured into multiple sections:

- `device:` -  This section contains the device specific runtime configurations including di-url, credential-file, key-type, key-enc, etc.


- `system-properties:` - This section contains the runtime environment variables.


- `workers:` The section contains the configuration to select desired functionality for the device. The deployer can pick and choose the functionality during runtime.


# Starting the Device Service

***NOTE:*** Make sure that `di-url` is set to the correct address.

##  Run as Standalone service.
Open a terminal, change directory to `<fdo-pri-src>/component-samples/demo/device/` and execute following command.

```
$ cd <fdo-pri-src>/component-samples/demo/device
$ java -jar device.jar
```

##  Run as Docker Service

Open a terminal, change directory to `<fdo-pri-src>/component-samples/demo/device/` and execute following command.

```
docker-compose up --build
```

In case you need super user access, prefix 'sudo -E' to above command.

The `device.p12` must contain the following data:
- The device's private key
- The device's public key or certificate (PKCS12 format).

PS: If `device.p12` file is not present, then the file is autogenerated during runtime.

The device will initialize and exit.  A `credentials.bin` file will be created containing the device state.
Removing this file will make the device re-initialize the next time it runs.

During device initialization, Manufacturer server must be available.

# TO1-2 Protocol

Execute the following code the initiate TO1 and TO2.

##  Run as Standalone service.
```
$ cd <fdo-pri-src>/component-samples/demo/device
$ java -jar device.jar
```

##  Run as Docker Service

Open a terminal, change directory to `<fdo-pri-src>/component-samples/demo/device/` and execute following command.

```
docker-compose up --build
```

The device will be onboarded.

The rendezvous and owner servers must be available during this step.
