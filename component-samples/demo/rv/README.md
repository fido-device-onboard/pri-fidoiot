# Getting the executable

Use the following commands to build FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) Protocol Reference Implementation
(PRI) Rendezvous (RV) component sample source.
For the instructions in this document, `<fdo-pri-src>` refers to the path of the FDO PRI folder 'pri-fidoiot'.
```
$ cd <fdo-pri-src>/service/component-samples/rv/
$ mvn clean install
```

This will copy the required executables and libraries into <fdo-pri-src>/demo/rv/.

# Configuring the FDO PRI RV Sample

RV runtime arguments:

- `rv_port`

  RV server port.

  Default value: 8040

- `rv_database_connection_url`

   JDBC URL for connection to database. Includes the database driver name, port number for database and the location of `.db` file

  Default value: jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost:8050/./target/data/rvs

- `rv_database_username`

  RV database username.

  Default value: sa

- `rv_database_password`

  RV database password.

  Default value: <no-password>

- `rv_database_port`

  RV database port number.

  Default value: 8050

- `epid_online_url`

  EPID Verification Service URL for EPID device signature verification.

  Default value: https://verify.epid-sbx.trustedservices.intel.com/
  Other server options: https://verify.epid.trustedservices.intel.com/ (production EPID verification server), https://localhost:1180 (onprem verification service)

- `epid_test_mode`

   EPID devices can be tested using `Test` mode, it is intended for supporting onboarding for `development` and `test` devices. Enabling the test mode means signature verification won't be performed for the device.

   Default value: false

   **NOTE** Not recommended for use in production systems.

- `catalina_home`

  Tomcat configuration for catalina home.

  Default value: ./target/tomcat

- `rv_protocol_scheme`

  Enables the service to run in https mode. Pass argument value `https` for the same. For all other values, the server service defaults to `http` scheme.

  Default value: https

- `rv_https_port`

  Allows enduser to select a port for accepting HTTPS requests.
  **NOTE** This property is not required if service is running in `http` mode.

  Default value: 443

- `rv_ssl_keystore`

  Provides path for SSL keystore to be used by the service, in case it runs in HTTPS mode.
  **NOTE** This property is not required if service is running in `http` mode.

  Default value: <fdo-pri-src>/component-samples/demo/rv/certs/ssl.p12

- `rv_ssl_keystore_password`

  Provides password for the specified keystore.
  **NOTE** This property is not required if service is running in `http` mode.

  Default keystore password: fdo123

## Support for OnDie devices

Refer to [Demo README](../README.md) for steps to configure rendezvous to support OnDie devices.

# Enabling Remote Access to DB

Remote access to H2 Sample Storage DB has been disabled by default. Enabling the access creates a security hole in the system which makes it vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.

To enable remote access to DB update the `db.tcpServer` and `webAllowOthers` properties in `<fdo-pri-src>/service/component-samples/rv/src/main/java/org/fidoalliance/fdo/sample/RvServerApp.java` file

```
db.tcpServer = -tcp -tcpAllowOthers -ifNotExists -tcpPort <rv_db_port>
webAllowOthers = true
```

**IMPORTANT: Not recommended to enable this setting especially on production systems.**

# Starting the rv service

Refer the [Docker Commands](../README.md/#docker-commands) to start the service.

# Allowlist and Denylist Configuration

- RV provides the option to allow and deny requests based on the owner, manufacturer and reseller public keys and based on the GUID used in the Device Ownership Voucher
header.
- To add entries to these allowlist and denylist, update the `config.properties` file in `<fdo-pri-src>/util/storage-samples/storage-rv-sample/src/main/resources` location and rebuild the code and restart the docker or update the `config.properties` in `<fdo-pri-src>/component-samples/demo/rv` and restart the docker.
- Once updated, rebuild the code, rebuild RV docker image and then start the docker.
- The hashes for the default public keys present of owner, manufacturer and reseller are already added in allowlist configuration of component sample. The table below lists them.

  | Hashes in Allowlist | PRI-FIDOIOT Component |
  | --- | --- |

- To add entries to allowlist and denylist for public key, public key hash need to be calculated. Refer [Generating Public Key Hash](#calculate-sha256-hash-of-a-public-key) for the steps to generate public key hash from public key.

**IMPORTANT** This is an example implementation using simplified credentials. This must be changed while performing production deployment

# Calculate SHA256 hash of a public key

```
$ openssl x509 -in cert.pem -pubkey -noout | openssl enc -base64 -d > example_allowlist_publickey.der

$ cat example_allowlist_publickey.der | openssl dgst -sha256 | awk '/s/{print toupper($2)}'
```

***NOTE:*** Input file cert.pem is an X509 certificate.

# Configuring RV for HTTPS/TLS Communication

By default, the RV uses HTTP for all communications on port 8040. In addition to that, the RV can be configured to handle HTTPS request from the owner & device on port 8443.

- Generate the Keystore/Certificate for the RV. [REFER](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19509-01/820-3503/6nf1il6er/index.html)

  * Ensure that the web certificate is issued to the resolvable domain of the Rendezvous server. Refer the above section to generate the keystore.

- Copy the generated Keystore/Certificate to `<fdo-pri-src>/component-samples/demo/rv/certs` folder.

- Update the following environment varibles in `<fdo-pri-src>/component-samples/demo/rv/rv.env` file

    |  Variable            |  Value            |             description       |
    | ---------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
    | rv_protocol_scheme  | https             | To enable HTTPS communication.|
    | rv_https_port       | port number       | The given port number will be used for HTTPS communication. |
    | rv_ssl_keystore     | keystore-filename | filename of Keystore that is present in the certs folder.|
    | rv_ssl_keystore-password| keystore-password | password of the keystore. |

    **NOTE:** Appropriate security measures with respect to key-store management should be considered while performing production deployment of RV.
    Avoid using the default keystore available for production deployment.
